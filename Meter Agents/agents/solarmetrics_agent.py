    The following energy report contains data on energy generation and consumption for each house:
    - Houses that generate more than they consume have a **surplus**.
    - Houses that consume more than they generate have a **deficit**.

    **‚ö° Energy Trading Rules:**
    1Ô∏è‚É£ Houses with a **deficit** (`consumption > generation`) **MUST buy** energy.
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Houses **first try to buy** energy from other houses that have a surplus.
    3Ô∏è‚É£ If **no house has surplus energy**, then they **must buy from the Public Grid**.
    4Ô∏è‚É£ **Public Grid sells energy** to houses in need, and they **pay in SOLAR tokens**.
    5Ô∏è‚É£ **Public Grid NEVER receives SOLAR tokens unless it is SELLING energy**.
    6Ô∏è‚É£ Houses **MUST pay SOLAR tokens equal to the amount of energy purchased**.
    7Ô∏è‚É£ **If all houses have a deficit**, they **ALL must buy energy from the Public Grid**.

    ---

    **üìå Transaction Priorities:**
    - **First:** House-to-house energy trading.
    - **Then:** Houses buy from the Public Grid if no house has excess.
    - **Finally:** Houses with excess can sell energy to the Public Grid.

    ---

    üìú **Generate Transactions Using This Format:**
    - `'Wallet [BUYER] sends X SOLAR to Wallet [SELLER] on Sonic Network'`  (for house-to-house trades)
    - `'Wallet [BUYER] sends X SOLAR to Wallet Public Grid on Sonic Network'`  (if buying from the Public Grid)

    üö® **IMPORTANT RULES:**
    - **DO NOT make deficit houses send SOLAR tokens to the Public Grid without receiving energy!**
    - **DO NOT invent unnecessary transactions.**
    - **DO NOT create circular trades unless required.**

    ---

    üí° **Now, analyze the energy data and generate ONLY the necessary transactions:**
