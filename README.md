## 🌎 Why This Matters?
### **Blackouts, Water Shortages & Energy Dependency – A LatAm Reality**
Latin America is suffering from severe **droughts**, leading to **blackouts** because most of the region's energy depends on **hydroelectric power**.  

💡 **The obvious solution? Solar energy!**  
But **traditional On-Grid solar systems** rely on public utilities, meaning houses buy/sell energy from the grid – **not from each other**.  

### **💡 What if houses could trade energy P2P?**
**Solarmetrics** enables homes in a condo/neighborhood to **buy and sell energy peer-to-peer (P2P)** using AI-powered smart meters and **blockchain-based payments**.  

✅ Sell surplus energy 🔁 Buy when in deficit  
✅ Inject **clean** energy into the grid 🌱  
✅ Earn **SOLAR tokens** for contributing energy ⚡  
✅ No middlemen, just **AI-driven automation** 🤖  

This is not just an idea; **we built the metering system!** It’s powered by **blockchain, AI agents (ZerePy), and the Sonic Network**.  

💭 **Imagine a future where every smart meter is an AI agent managing decentralized energy trading.**   
The hardware **already exists** – it’s just a matter of **integration!**
