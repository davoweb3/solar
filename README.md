# Solarmetrics ✨🏡🌌 - Sonic DeFAi Hackathon 2025

**Decentralized Energy Trading for a Sustainable Future**

## Overview 🌐
Solarmetrics is a **DeFi-powered, AI-enhanced decentralized energy trading platform** designed to optimize solar energy **consumption and distribution** within local communities. Built on the **Sonic blockchain**, Solarmetrics enables households to **buy, sell, and monitor energy in real-time**, ensuring **fair pricing, efficiency, and sustainability**. This project is part of the **Sonic DeFAi Hackathon**.

## Key Features ✨
- ⚡ **Decentralized Energy Marketplace**: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading using **ERC-20 SOLAR tokens**.
- 🔄 **AI-Powered Energy Optimization**: Predicts surplus/deficit energy using **real-time consumption data from energy meters**.
- ⌚ **Automated Energy Settlement**: Secure, trustless transactions on the **Sonic blockchain**.
- 🛠 **Real-Time Monitoring**: AI agents **monitor** energy production, consumption, and transactions via an intuitive Web3 dashboard.
- 🔗 **AI-Driven Social Impact**: Whenever the system injects clean energy into the public grid, an **AI-generated tweet** raises awareness about decentralized renewable energy.

## How It Works ⚛
1. **Energy Tokenization**: Each house receives **SOLAR tokens** based on energy contribution. *(The swap process is not developed here, but it can be easily implemented.)*
2. **Decentralized Trading**: Users trade excess energy using **smart contracts on Sonic**.
3. **AI & Automation**: The **ZerePy AI agent** monitors and optimizes energy allocation.
4. **Social Engagement**: AI generates **real-time tweets** announcing clean energy injections to the public grid.

## Architecture ⚖️
Solarmetrics integrates **DeFi, AI, and blockchain** to enable **transparent, decentralized energy trading**:
- **Frontend**: React + Web3 (**ThirdWeb** for wallet integration, **Chakra UI** for styling).
- **Backend**: AI agent powered by **ZerePy**, running on a server to handle energy analytics.
- **Smart Contracts**: **ERC-20 SOLAR token** built on **Sonic blockchain**, managed via **ThirdWeb API**.
- **Energy Data Simulation**: Uses real-world energy patterns to **simulate grid behavior**, built on **Node.js**.
- **LLM Integration**: GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI.

## What You Will See in the Demo 🎥
Solarmetrics provides a **dashboard** showcasing how **AI agents manage decentralized energy transactions**.

- **Main Agent**: The **ZerePy-based AI agent** receives **raw data** from **simulated energy sensors**, communicates with OpenAI, and makes optimal trading decisions. It determines whether **households trade among themselves or interact with the public grid**.
- **Meter Agents**: Each **Sonic Meter** is a real **AI agent powered by ZerePy**, which listens to and interprets data, then **executes transactions** on the **Sonic Blaze testnet**.
  - **Four AI meters** represent individual households.
  - **One public AI meter** represents the **Public Energy Company/Public Grid**.
  - Each AI agent has its **own wallet address**.
- **Energy Data Simulation**: Uses real-world energy patterns to **simulate grid behavior**.

Example Data Format:
```json
{"weather":"sunny","houses":[
  {"house":"H1","generation":5,"consumption":0,"voltage":"110.0","powerFactor":"1.00"},
  {"house":"H2","generation":5,"consumption":0,"voltage":"110.0","powerFactor":"1.00"},
  {"house":"H3","generation":5,"consumption":0,"voltage":"110.0","powerFactor":"1.00"},
  {"house":"H4","generation":5,"consumption":0,"voltage":"110.0","powerFactor":"1.00"}
]}
```
