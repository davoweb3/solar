⚡ Solarmetrics ✨🏡🌞
🚀 Sonic DeFAi Hackathon 2025 – Decentralized AI-Powered Energy Trading



🌎 Why This Matters?
Blackouts, Water Shortages & Energy Dependency – A LatAm Reality
Latin America is suffering from severe droughts, leading to blackouts because most of the region's energy depends on hydroelectric power.

💡 The obvious solution? Solar energy!
But traditional On-Grid solar systems rely on public utilities, meaning houses buy/sell energy from the grid – not from each other.

💡 What if houses could trade energy P2P?
Solarmetrics enables homes in a condo/neighborhood to buy and sell energy peer-to-peer (P2P) using AI-powered smart meters and blockchain-based payments.
✅ Sell surplus energy 🔁 Buy when in deficit
✅ Inject clean energy into the grid 🌱
✅ Earn SOLAR tokens for contributing energy ⚡
✅ No middlemen, just AI-driven automation 🤖

This is not just an idea; we built the metering system! It’s powered by blockchain, AI agents (ZerePy), and the Sonic Network.

💭 Imagine a future where every smart meter is an AI agent managing decentralized energy trading.
The hardware already exists – it’s just a matter of integration!

🔥 Hackathon Overview
Solarmetrics is a DeFi-powered, AI-enhanced decentralized energy trading platform, designed to optimize solar energy consumption & distribution within local communities.

⚡ Built on: Sonic Blockchain
⚡ Powered by: AI Agents (ZerePy) + Smart Contracts + Real-Time Energy Data
⚡ Hackathon Goal: Build intelligent NET meters that autonomously trade energy on-chain!

🚀 Key Features
✨ Decentralized Energy Marketplace – Trade energy P2P with ERC-20 SOLAR tokens
✨ AI-Powered Energy Optimization – Real-time surplus/deficit predictions
✨ Automated Smart Contracts – Energy payments 100% on-chain
✨ Live AI Monitoring Dashboard – Visualize transactions, energy flows & AI decisions
✨ Social Impact – Injecting clean energy into the grid posts a tweet announcing the event

🏗️ How It Works
1️⃣ Energy Tokenization – Each house receives SOLAR tokens for its energy contribution.
2️⃣ Decentralized Energy Trading – AI agents facilitate peer-to-peer transactions.
3️⃣ Smart Contracts & Automation – All trades are recorded on Sonic blockchain.
4️⃣ AI-Generated Reports – The system tweets energy contributions in real-time.

🛠 Important Notes
💰 GPT-4 is more accurate but costly to run. If the demo stops working due to quota limits, email me, and I’ll add credits!
⚡ GPT-4 takes 5-10 seconds per request (GPT-3.5-turbo is faster ~2 secs).
