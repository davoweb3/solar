**Decentralized Energy Trading for a Sustainable Future**

## Overview
Solarmetrics is a **DeFi-powered, AI-enhanced decentralized energy trading platform** designed to optimize solar energy consumption and distribution in local communities. Built on the **Sonic blockchain**, Solarmetrics enables households to **buy, sell, and monitor energy in real time**, ensuring **fair pricing, efficiency, and sustainability**. This project is being developed as part of the **Sonic DeFAi Hackathon**.

## Key Features ‚ú®
- ‚ö° **Decentralized Energy Marketplace**: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading using **ERC-20 SOLAR tokens**.
- üîÑ **AI-Powered Energy Optimization**: Predicts surplus/deficit energy using **real-time consumption data from Energy meters**.
- ‚åö **Automated Energy Settlement**: Secure, trustless transactions on the **Sonic blockchain**.
- üõ† **Real-Time Monitoring**: AI agents can be monitorized in real time **energy production, consumption, and transactions** via an intuitive Web3 dashboard.
- üîó **AI-Driven Social Impact**: Every time the system injects clean energy into the public grid, an **AI-generated tweet** is posted to raise awareness about decentralized renewable energy.

## How It Works ‚öõ
1. **Energy Tokenization**: Each house receives **SOLAR tokens** based on energy contribution.( Swap process is not developed here, but it is easy to figure out)
2. **Decentralized Trading**: Users trade excess energy using smart contracts on Sonic.
3. **AI & Automation**: The **ZerePy AI agent** monitors and optimizes energy allocation.s.
4. **Social Engagement**: AI generates real-time **tweets announcing clean energy injections** to the public grid.

## Architecture ‚öñÔ∏è
Solarmetrics combines **DeFi, AI, and blockchain** to enable **transparent, decentralized energy trading**:
- **Frontend**: React + Web3 (ThirdWeb for wallet integration, Chakra UI for styling).
- **Backend**: AI agent powered by **ZerePy**, running on a server to handle energy analytics.
- **Smart Contracts**: ERC-20 SOLAR token built on **Sonic blockchain** and managed by ThirdWeb API.
- **Energy Data Simulation**: Uses real-world energy patterns to **simulate grid behavior**, built on nodejs.
- **LLM using GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo from OpenAI**

  ## What you will see in the Demo? ‚öñÔ∏è
Solarmetrics provides a dashboard that shows how AI agents manages in a descentralized way the different actions in the Solar transaction process.
- **Main Agent**: The main agent is a Zerepy based IA agent that receives the raw data from simulated energy sensors , communicates with OpenAI engine and takes decisions about how to trade in the most optimal way . It will basically decide either if the Houses trades between them or with the Public Energy Grid
- **Meter Agents**: Each SONIC METER is a real AI agent powered by **ZerePy**, that listens and interprets the data and executes transactions in the Sonic Blaze testnet network , sending or receiving tokens according to the requiered surplus or deficit. There are 4 AI meters that represents a House each one and 1 AI meter that belons to the Public Energy company or Public Grid . Total 5 AI agents with a wallet address each one.

- **Energy Data Simulation**: Uses real-world energy patterns to **simulate grid behavior**.

## Getting Started üöÄ
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/solar.git
cd solarmetrics
```
###Note: Each folder has its own instructions for deploying. You can use Replit for one click deployment of Zerepy.

### 2. Install Dependencie
```bash
npm install
```
### 3. Start the Application
```bash
npm start
```
### 4. Connect Your AI agents to (Sonic Network Required)
Ensure your wallet is connected to **Sonic testnet** before interacting with the platform.
