**Decentralized Energy Trading for a Sustainable Future**

## Motivation üåûüåç
Latin America faces a severe drought crisis, affecting countries like **Colombia, Ecuador, and Brazil**. Many governments are encouraging private initiatives for **solar energy generation** in homes, buildings, and residential communities. The **lack of rainfall** has led to continuous energy shortages, which could be mitigated with decentralized solar energy units.

Each household can **generate between 2 to 5 kWh** daily with minimal investment in **solar panels and inverters**. During the **day**, houses can produce and trade surplus energy, while at **night**, they rely on the public grid (assuming an **on-grid system**). Existing centralized energy trading models **lack transparency and accessibility**, but now, **blockchain technology enables decentralized, fair, and automated trading**.

With **Solarmetrics**, homeowners can:
- **Sell excess energy** and earn **SOLAR tokens**.
- **Buy affordable energy** when others in their community have a surplus.
- **Trade energy with public utility companies**, storing tokens for future use.

The goal is to **maximize clean energy injection into the grid**, promoting **sustainability** while leveraging **AI agents** to automate the entire process. Each solar meter could be integrated with an **AI agent** (e.g., running on a **Raspberry Pi**) and connected to a **bidirectional net meter** with some tweaking ( not covered in this demo)  that tracks energy flow and it will become a solar power meter into an intelligent AI meter!.

## Overview üåê
Solarmetrics is a **DeFi-powered, AI-enhanced decentralized energy trading platform** designed to optimize solar energy **consumption and distribution** within local communities. Built on the **Sonic blockchain**, Solarmetrics enables households to **buy, sell, and monitor energy in real-time**, ensuring **fair pricing, efficiency, and sustainability**. This project is part of the **Sonic DeFAi Hackathon**.

## Key Features ‚ú®
- ‚ö° **Decentralized Energy Marketplace**: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading using **ERC-20 SOLAR tokens**.
- üîÑ **AI-Powered Energy Optimization**: Predicts surplus/deficit energy using **real-time consumption data from energy meters**.
- ‚åö **Automated Energy Settlement**: Secure, trustless transactions on the **Sonic blockchain**.
- üõ† **Real-Time Monitoring**: AI agents **monitor** energy production, consumption, and transactions via an intuitive Web3 dashboard.

## How It Works ‚öõ
1. **Energy Tokenization**: Each house receives **SOLAR tokens** based on energy contribution. *(The swap process is not developed here, but it can be easily implemented.)*
2. **Decentralized Trading**: Users trade excess energy using **smart contracts on Sonic**.
3. **AI & Automation**: The **ZerePy AI agent** monitors and optimizes energy allocation.

## Architecture ‚öñÔ∏è
Solarmetrics integrates **DeFi, AI, and blockchain** to enable **transparent, decentralized energy trading**:

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next + Web3 (Vercel).
- **AI Agent Infrastructure**: **ZerePy** framework for building and managing AI agent network.
- **LLM Engine**: **OpenAI** (GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo) for intelligent decision-making and natural language processing.
- **Blockchain Data Queries**: **Nebula AI** for efficient querying of on-chain data and analytics.
- **Smart Contracts**: **ERC-20 SOLAR token** built on **Sonic blockchain**, managed via **ThirdWeb API**.
- **Energy Data Simulation**: Uses real-world energy patterns to **simulate grid behavior**, built on **Node.js**.

## What You Will See in the Demo üé•
Solarmetrics provides a **dashboard** showcasing how **AI agents manage decentralized energy transactions**.

### Components
- **Main Agent**: The **ZerePy-based AI agent** receives **raw data** from **simulated energy sensors**, communicates with **OpenAI's LLM**, and makes optimal trading decisions. It determines whether **households trade among themselves or interact with the public grid**. **Nebula AI** is used to query on-chain data for real-time analytics.
- **Meter Agents**: Each **Sonic Meter** is a real **AI agent powered by ZerePy**, which listens to and interprets data, then **executes transactions** on the **Sonic Blaze testnet**.
  - **Four AI meters** represent individual households.
  - **One public AI meter** represents the **Public Energy Company/Public Grid**.
  - Each AI agent has its **own wallet address**.
- **Energy Data Simulation**: Uses real-world energy patterns to **simulate grid behavior**.
